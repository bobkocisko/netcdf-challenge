This python project is simply here to track my usage of python's netcdf4 plugin to examine the netCDF file provided and print general information.  I decided to use python initially for this because I figured it would be a quick path to iterate around browsing the data without waiting to setup the dependencies and compilation environment of c++, and without depending on the compile/run cycle.
